# sundial
A Chrome extension to assist in fetching archived versions of a page.

## What does it do?

When you find yourself on a website that is not fully accessible (but may be available in an archive), you can click the toolbar icon to trigger tha plugin. It will redirect you to `archive.ph` with the query for the page you're currently on. This can all be done manually; the plugin is just a convenience (gets rid of the tedious copy/paste steps).

## Installation

1. Download the package from Github.

```
git clone https://github.com/rhiro/sundial.git
```

2. Install the extension

    * Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
    * Run "Load unpacked" and pick the `sundial` directory you fetched above.
    * Configure the app to appear in the toolbar, to make activation convenient. Enable `Details > Pin to toolbar`.
